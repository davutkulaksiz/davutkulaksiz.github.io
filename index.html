      <p>
        I am a mid-level Software Engineer specializing in
        <b>frontend development</b>, currently employed at
        <strong

            >Picus Security</a
          ></strong
        >. In my role, I contribute to the development of an Attack Surface
        Management tool, focusing on frontend features and architecture
        improvements using
        <b>React, TypeScript, React Query, and Tailwind CSS</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I worked as a part-time frontend developer at
        <strong
          ><a href="https://www.jotform.com/" target="_blank" rel=""
            >Jotform</a
          ></strong
        >, where I developed enterprise tools, enhanced accessibility, and
        collaborated closely with UX Designers and Product Managers to deliver a
        cohesive user experience. Prior to this, I held the role of Junior
        Software Developer at <strong>JFORCE</strong>, where I focused on
        frontend features and conducted an AI and PyTorch bootcamp for one of
        Turkey’s leading defense corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also actively engaged in the tech community. As an organizer for
        the <strong>Google Cloud Developer Community Ankara</strong>, I led
        initiatives like the <em>Cloud Jamathon</em>, where I developed skills
        in event management and community building. Additionally, as a core team
        member of <strong>Google DSC Hacettepe</strong>, I organized events such
        as the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge"
          target="_blank"
          rel=""
          >Solution Challenge 2021 (People-Peace)</a
        >, Python and Java workshops, and an advanced frontend webinar to foster
        technical knowledge sharing among tech enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these experiences, I have strengthened my technical expertise,
        leadership, and communication skills, gaining a deep understanding of
        the importance of collaboration in delivering impactful and innovative
        solutions.

        <p>
          The <strong>ML Interface Wizard</strong> is a tool designed to
          automatically generate a user interface (UI) for any
          <strong>Machine Learning model</strong>, streamlining the process of
          testing and interacting with models. When model parameters or metrics
          are updated, the tool dynamically regenerates the front-end based on
          provided metadata, ensuring compatibility with the latest model
          changes. This UI generation facilitates easy access to model
          predictions, validation of model performance, and enables additional
          testing by providing an intuitive and accessible interface for users.
