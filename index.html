        I am a mid-level Software Engineer specializing in <b>frontend development</b>, currently employed at <strong><a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Picus Security</a></strong>. In my role, I contribute to the development of an Attack Surface Management tool, focusing on frontend features and architecture improvements using <b>React, TypeScript, React Query, and Tailwind CSS</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I worked as a part-time frontend developer at <strong><a href="https://www.jotform.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Jotform</a></strong>, where I developed enterprise tools, enhanced accessibility, and collaborated closely with UX Designers and Product Managers to deliver a cohesive user experience. Prior to this, I held the role of Junior Software Developer at <strong>JFORCE</strong>, where I focused on frontend features and conducted an AI and PyTorch bootcamp for one of Turkey’s leading defense corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also actively engaged in the tech community. As an organizer for the <strong>Google Cloud Developer Community Ankara</strong>, I led initiatives like the <em>Cloud Jamathon</em>, where I developed skills in event management and community building. Additionally, as a core team member of <strong>Google DSC Hacettepe</strong>, I organized events such as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge" target="_blank" rel="">Solution Challenge 2021 (People-Peace)</a>, Python and Java workshops, and an advanced frontend webinar to foster technical knowledge sharing among tech enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these experiences, I have strengthened my technical expertise, leadership, and communication skills, gaining a deep understanding of the importance of collaboration in delivering impactful and innovative solutions.

        <p>
          During the creation of a data application based on a <strong>Machine Learning model</strong>, 
          it may be necessary to write a front-end application for that model. 
          When the underlying model changes, 
          a new front-end is generated based on model metrics and provided metadata. 
          The application generates a UI for any <strong>Machine Learning model</strong>. 
          It allows easier usage of the model, and an easier way to check its correctness as well as to provide additional testing data.

          I've previously designed a static website with Bootstrap but the
